# Veilbreaker
Adventure and clear hostile regions harnessing the power of stealth and evasiveness.

# MASSIVE PROGRESS RESET
Unfortunately, OneDrive decided to be an absolute ass and delete all my scripts. Majority of my files were overwritten, and caused my game to become buggy and unstable. For that reason, I have decided to restart from the bottom and work my way back up. Since I already know how my game works, it won't be long until I make a full recovery.
