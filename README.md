Unfortunately, OneDrive decided to be an absolute ass and delete all my scripts. Majority of my files were overwritten, and caused my game to become buggy and unstable. For that reason, I have decided to restart from the bottom and work my way back up. Since I already know how my game works, it won't be long until I make a full recovery.

> Development will receive a massive boost
> I just lost ~50 hours of development lol (that includes actual functioning enemies, audio, a working level, a tutorial, and objectives)
> Hopefully will be finished by 2/20
